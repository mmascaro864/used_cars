### Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using the Craiglist used car data to understand:
- Average Vehicle Price by reviewing
    - Which state(s) had the highest average vehicle price?
    - Which vehicle manufacturer has the highest average vehicle price?
    - Which vehicle type has the highest average vehicle price?
- Vehicle Age by reviewing
    - How vehicle price is influenced by vehicle age across vehicle conditions?
    - How vehicle price is influenced by vehicle age across vehicle drive type?
- Vehicle Location by reviewing
    - Where are the highest priced vehicle located
